Command		Status

asm
attr		Used Modified nitros source merged with disassembly, 
			assembles bin equivilent
backup		OK, commented disassembily
basic09		patched by vitway, so will need disassembling.
binex		Used Nitros source, modified to compile to be binary 
			equivilent
build		OK		
callmenu	dis, contains basic09 icode.
cmp		dis, Looks like it was written in C, comments in Nitros9 
			cmp src support this as they note it's re-writtin 
			in asm.
copy		OK
d		dis, seems to be another version of dir.
date		OK
dcheck		dis, looks to be a compiled program, probably C.
debug
del		OK
deldir		OK, Commented disassembly.
dir		OK
dircopy		dis, looks like may be 3rd party and compiled.
display		OK, Commented disassembly.
dsave		dis, looks like it was written in C or Pascal, certainly
			a complied language.
dump		OK
echo		OK
edit		dis, assembles
exbin		OK, Commented disassembly.
format		OK, Commented disassembly.
free		OK
graphics	See below.
ident		OK
link		OK
list		OK
load		OK
login		OK
makdir		OK
mdir		OK, Commented disassembly. 
merge		OK
mfree		OK, Commented disassembly.
os9gen		OK, Commented disassembly.
patch		dis
procs		OK, Commented disassembly.
pwd		Used Modified nitros source, assembles bin equivilent
pxd		Used Modified nitros source, assembles bin equivilent
rename		OK	
runb
save		OK
setime		OK
shell		OK
sleep		OK
tee		OK
tmode		Based on D64 tmode src modified to add Beta oprtions...
			as this is probably what DD did!
tsmon		OK
unlink		OK
utils		This is a file containg :
			copy, del, dir, attr, merge, backup, rename all as
			one file, so that they can be quickly loaded together.
verify		OK
wait		dis, looks compiled, C probably
xmode		OK

graphics is made up of two joined modules gfxpack, the actual graphics driver 
and basext the interface module for basic09. Since chrset is aslo part of the 
graphics subsystem it is also listed here
gfxpack		OK, original vitway source
basext		OK, partially commented disassembily
chrset		OK, disassembily

Status :
OK 	I have source that compiles as binary equivilent.
dis	I have a bare disassembly made with disasm from nitros.
other	as comments
blank	I have not tackled yet. For graphics and chrset I believe the source is 
	on one of the beta disks.
