.OS9 disks are raw arrays of sectors, the first part of the first sector on
the disk defines the disk layout.

Generally this will be 40 or 80 tracks of either 16 or 18 sectors single or
double sided. This is generally double density (MFM) format
Some disks will however have a different number of sectors on track 0 which
will be single density (FM) format. 
This can all be determined from the header in the first sector.

All multi-byte words will be in Motorola format with the MSB in the lowest
location.

Name	Size	Purpose
DD.TOT 	3       Total number of sectors 
DD.TKS  1       Track size in sectors
DD.MAP  2       Number of bytes in allocation bit map
DD.BIT  2       Number of sectors/bit
DD.DIR  3       Address of root directory fd
DD.OWN  2       Owner
DD.ATT  1       Attributes
DD.DSK  2       Disk id
DD.FMT  1       Disk format; density/sides
DD.SPT  2       Sectors/track
DD.RES  2       Reserved for future use
DD.BT	3       System bootstrap sector
DD.BSZ	2       Size of system bootstrap
DD.DAT	5       Creation date
DD.NAM	32      Volume name
DD.OPT	32      option area

The DD.OPT area contains the following :

TYPE	1       Device type
PD.DRV  1       Drive number
PD.STP  1       Step rate
PD.TYP  1       Disk device type (5' 8' other)
PD.DNS  1       Density capability
PD.CYL  2       Number of cylinders
PD.SID  1       Number of surfaces
PD.VFY  1       0=verify disk writes
PD.SCT  2       Default sectors/track
PD.T0S  2       Default sectors/track tr00,s0
PD.ILV  1       Sector interleave offset


DD.TOT will be : 
(((number of tracks * number of sides)-1) * sectors per track) + track 0 sectors

The encoding of DD.FMt is as follows :

FMT.SIDE       %00000001           Single Sided=0, Double Sided=1
FMT.DNS        %00000010           Single Density=0, Double Density=1
FMT.TDNS       %00000100           Track Density: 48/135 TPI=0, 96 TPI=1
FMT.T0DN       %00100000           Track 0 Density, see FMT.DNS
